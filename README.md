A visualized A* path finder

I compiled with mingw on Windows
1. Install g++ v7.3.0 with the corresponding SFML libraries (any other version might work as well but I used this)
2. Copy SFML libs to /i686-w64-mingw32/lib/, the SFML include to /i686-w64-mingw32/include/ and the SFML bins to /i686-w64-mingw32/bin/
3. Add the C:\mingw32\bin to the system environment PATH
4. execute `compile.bat`
